					Inspired by this quote, the research team at the Department of Management and Commerce, Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning, Andhra Pradesh, India, set out to understand the role of psychological factors and their influence on individuals' financial decision-making. The study examines the hidden relationships between individuals' inherent behavioral nature and stock trading behavior. To help achieve this goal, we are conducting an online survey coupled with a stock market simulator to gain essential insights and feedback from individual investors and finance professionals.

					This study requires you to answer all the survey questions and participate in a simulated stock market scenario. It should take about 10 -15 minutes of your time to complete this entire exercise.

					The survey questions are self-explanatory and straightforward, and the instructions for the stock market exercise are provided after completing the survey.
